fbAuth v1.0.0

fbAuth is a simple class that completes an OAuth handshake with Facebook and
retrieves access tokens for your own account and (optionally) any applications
and/or pages you may have. The goal is to be as simple as possible, so this
requires no database, no memcache and doesn't really do anything beyond grab
access tokens. Once they're obtained you can do whatever you want with them of
course. In an ideal world you could just extend this with your own Facebook
class that does fancier stuff.
